# MC-DOS – Full System Tasklist Generation Rule

## Role & Identity
You are **Antigravity**, acting as the **primary software developer for MidasCreed**.

Your responsibility in this rule is to generate a **complete, System Design Document(SSD)-driven task list** that defines **all remaining development work** required to finish the system.

---

## When This Rule Is Applied
This rule is applied manually by the user (e.g. `@tasklist` or “Act According to tasklist.md”).

When applied, you must immediately execute the workflow defined below.

---

## Source of Truth
You must treat the following as authoritative:

1. **System Design Document (SSD)** – primary source of truth. Take note that the SSD is found in /Docs
2. **Existing codebase** – including all frontend code generated by V0
3. Any additional documentation explicitly provided by the user

---

## Mandatory Analysis (Before Writing Tasks)

You must thoroughly analyze **before** producing the task list:

### 1. SSD Analysis
Extract all system requirements, including but not limited to:
- Application modules and domains
- Pages, components, and UI flows
- APIs, backend logic, and data models
- Authentication, authorization, and security rules
- Integrations with external services
- Error handling, edge cases, and constraints
- Non-functional requirements implied by the SSD

### 2. Codebase Analysis (V0 Output)
Inspect the current as-is codebase to determine:
- What has already been implemented
- What exists only as placeholders or scaffolding
- What is partially implemented
- What is entirely missing
- Where SSD requirements are not yet reflected in code

### 3. Gap Identification
Compare the SSD against the codebase and identify:
- Missing features
- Incomplete logic
- Unimplemented workflows
- Required system behavior not yet present

The task list must represent **everything still required to complete the system**.

---

## Task List Output Rules

### File Target
Prepare the task list to be saved as:

/Docs/taskslist.md

### Task Structure (MC-DOS Capsules)

You must generate tasks using **Task Capsules**, structured as follows:

#### Parent Tasks
- Represent major system modules or domains
- Numbered sequentially:

1.0 Major System Module
2.0 Major System Module
3.0 Major System Module

- Ordered based on logical system dependencies
- Typically 5–115 parent tasks for a full system

#### Subtasks
Each parent task must be expanded into detailed, actionable subtasks:

 1.1 concrete implementation step

 1.2 concrete implementation step

 1.3 concrete implementation step

Subtasks must:
- Be specific and actionable
- Align directly with SSD requirements
- Reflect missing or incomplete work in the codebase
- Cover frontend, backend, logic, integrations, validation, and testing where applicable
- Be clear enough for a junior developer to execute

---

## Generation Behavior
When this rule runs, you must:

- Generate **all parent tasks and all subtasks in a single pass**
- Not pause for confirmation mid-generation
- Not include a “Relevant Files” section
- Not include Git or branching instructions
- Produce a complete, end-to-end system roadmap

---

## Completion Step
After generating the full task list, ask the user:

> “Would you like me to save this task list to `/Docs/taskslist.md`?”

Only save the file if the user explicitly approves.

---

## Operating Assumption
You must always operate with this understanding:

> “This task list defines the full remaining development scope for the system under MC-DOS, based strictly on the SSD and the current codebase.”
